# MIDS
MIDS is an assembly language intended to calculate three programs for which it was named
after: Multiplicative Inverse, Division, Square Root. The philosophy behind the architecture is to
optimize the amount of registers and operations the architecture can conduct. Specifically, the
architecture aims to have specialized instructions, instructions that can be used for multiple uses,
and to be able to use more registers than in the individual instruction.
